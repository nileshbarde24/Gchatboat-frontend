Event Description: The patient reached out to RxSight and left a voicemail.  Upon returning the patient’s call, the patient reports blurry uncorrected distance vision in the right eye after lock in.  Per the patient, she has a history of 8 cut RK in 1985, PRK enhancement in 1999, epi ON corneal crosslinking prior to cataract surgery in early 2021, then cataract surgery in early to mid 2021.  Her LAL was locked in in July 2021.  Following a one month long trip to Florida in November 2021 she reports blurry distance vision in the right eye with some shadowing and “kind of double.” She returned to Dr. Vrabec who performed a YAG capsulotomy without improvement in symptoms.  The patient said that Dr. Vrabec recommended a hard contact lens to improve the symptoms due to irregularity of her cornea.  She tried a soft CL without improvement and reported that it was “cumbersome.”  She currently wears glasses for distance when needed and they are a -1.00D.  The glasses are working well and she
is slowly adapting to monovision but it has been difficult.  Her vision fluctuates and is better in the morning than the evening.  She saw Dr. Arun Gulani in Jacksonville, FL for a consultation to improve her vision 3 weeks ago and is considering options for improvement.

Dr. Beckman delivered the lens after enlarging the wound to 2.8 mm without any deviations from his normal LAL surgical routine and without any complications/ The trailing haptic came off in the cartridge and was delivered into the eye missing the trailing haptic for both cases.

Complaint Number: 3353
Event Description: Dr Pugh had a 16 cut RK patient who he planned to do a scleral tunnel on due to extent of RK. I discussed nozzle length and widening the incision to accommodate the entire nozzle, as that was his plan. He said he was very hesitant to enlarge the incision more than the normal size. When he initially went into the eye, the incision was too small to accommodate the nozzle. He had to enlarge, and then reinserted the nozzle and delivered the lens, although the nozzle was not in all of the way. The lens came out slightly tilted. As Dr Pugh got lens into the proper position in the capsular bag, he noticed that the lens wasn’t centering because one of the haptics was “stuck” along the edge of the lens. After adding some OVD and lightly touching the haptic, it unstuck and popped back into the proper position and appeared to be undamaged. The lens then centered properly within the capsular bag. The surgeon used a suture to close the scleral tunnel incision. The haptic
appeared to be free when the lens was initially delivered into the eye, and seemed as if it stuck to the lens during the manipulation of the lens into the proper position in capsular bag. I did not have the best visibility due to blood from the scleral tunnel and the incision being smaller than needed. Dr Pugh plans to insert the nozzle further in on the patient’s next eye.

Event Description: Per a text message from Dr. Caywood on 8/31/23, “From a patient locked in 2 weeks ago. I still have a bizarre variant of visual vertigo sinc the last lockin. No vertigo but queasiness, definitely visual and not otologic.  When I wake up in morn I have to carefully (slowly) look from near objects to distance or there is mild queasiness.  Or close left eye.  Bizarre thing is that the UV glasses (clear ones) overside this.  How does that make sense?? When I read for awhile I also have to look to mid objects before looking out at distant mts. This is quite unpleasant but I assume no real remedy except hopefully time adaptation. This was not present at all before final lock in. Final lock in moved my focal distance 4-6” closer even tho it is supposed to just lock in – I read somewhere earlier on that lockins “always move focus somewhat closer” but I don’t remember where that was written. I do find that the brightness of normal sunny day inside my house even, causes a
glare effect so I often wear the UV sunglasses indoors.  I was doing that for awhile.” - Dr. Caywood is seeing the pt next week to follow up.

Event Description: On 8/31/23 when Dr. Suresh Mandava was performing a Vivity IOL exchange for an LAL. After removing the Vivity, Dr. Mandava said he wanted to deliver the LAL into the anterior chamber, when he delivered the LAL it came out flipped. Dr. Mandava said he “could not flip the LAL in the correct orientation without scraping the endothelium” and he decided to exchange LAL SN: 70048460429 for new LAL SN: 70048460430 during the same surgery. Dr. Mandava injected the new LAL into the capsular bag, once this was completed Dr. Mandava said there was a posterior capsular rent and he needed to perform a vitrectomy. Once the vitrectomy was complete Dr. Mandava was able to position the new LAL to his desired location with optic capture. Dr. Mandava did not enlarge the incision past the original 2.8mm and the LAL SN: 70048460429 was cut in 3 pieces to remove. Dr. Mandava expressed concern that he believes in his surgical opinion, that he thinks the Vivity haptic caused scaring over
the course of the 9 months the Vivity was implanted and that caused the weakening of the capsular bag and then when he implanted the LAL that caused the posterior capsular rent.

After the second lock on 09/06/2023 that patient came in on 09/15/2023 complaining of decrease vision in the right eye since the second lock in. Dr Giordano did a thorough exam and couldn’t find anything she felt would be causing the visual changes and RX shift. Out of abundance of precaution on 09/15/2023 she restarted the patient on Prolensa QD OU and Pred Forte BID OD for two weeks and then decreased to QD for two weeks. Dr Giordano said that day if she was hard pressed there may have been very mild diffuse macular thickening compared to previous OCT’s. The patient returned after discontinuing drops and on visual acuity testing and MR
her vision returned to where it had been but the patient still complained that her vision quality had not returned to what it was prior to lock in 2 being done. Dr Giordano is not seeing this patient back for another 2-3 months as they are fully locked in and there is nothing she can identify as a cause.

Event Description: Patient has had a myopic shift in both eyes approx. 16 months post Lock in OU. UPDATE (AWARE DATE: 11/10/2023: RxSight team has call with Dr. Whitman and summarizes that based on the data available, both implanted LALs should be locked in (based on adequate dilation and 2 lock-in treatments performed). Team hypothesis is something physiological is occurring that is changing the patient’s vision and refraction. Dr. Whitman states that after LAL implant, topography showed corneal flattening of ~3D which was unusual. They waited on light treatments but cornea did not return to original pre-surgery shape. Dr. Whitman hypothesized that perhaps the complex cornea changing shape is responsible for the vision/refractive changes and he did not believe the LAL was responsible. His plan was to give it another 6 months and re-evaluate then. Patient is wearing distance glasses only at night.

The patient returned and did not like the near vision and wanted to go back to a plano, distance result. The patient had a second treatment that was targeted for plano. He then returned for a third treatment and still had a residual prescription, so they treated a third time. He then returned to the office for his next visit on 11/21/23, and his MR had gotten significantly more myopic. The CTS pulled the data from the LDD and looked through the patient's chart to find the clinic entered a hyperopic sphere at 11/7/23 treatment (+0.75 instead of -0.75) on the 3rd LDD treatment.The treating physician is waiting to see if the MR stabilizes and then will consider a 4th treatment.
